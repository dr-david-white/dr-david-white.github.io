Welcome! I am a senior lecturer [at Staffordshire University](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/people/david-white) where I teach computer games programming and also involve myself in research in the fields of articial life (agent based models / simulations) and computer games. 

I have a PhD in Artificial Life and Simulation from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/eese/communications-sensing/hit-team/index.aspx) where I was a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof Bob Stone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-bob-stone-21b86918), who I'd previously worked with at [Virtual Presence / Virtalis](https://www.virtalis.com/). 

I also have a BSc (hons) in Computer Science (1st class) from Staffordshire University. 

Industry Background
======
I have been working in and around the games industry for 20+ years. I principally write in C++, but have also developed apps in Java, C#, and Objective C, which means that I can pick up new languages fairly quickly. I have developed games engines for various platforms (PC / Mac / Android / iOS) in OpenGL, OpenGL ES and several versions of DirectX. I have worked with VR since 2000, and AR from 2012. In 2015 I developed an app called [Big Red Arrow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secretattic.bigredarrow&hl=en_US&gl=US). I wrote my own AR code to avoid relying on 3rd party licenses (BRA probably needs updating on both iOS and Android, this is on my very long todo list!). 

I started out at Virtual Presence (now Virtalis) working on a VR simulator for the Ministry of Defence - specifically, a 20mm anti-aircraft gun simulator. VR was expensive in those days, £10,000 for a decent graphics card, and £80,000 for a VR headset! I then moved to Headfirst productions to work on the now cult game [Call of Cthulhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Cthulhu:_Dark_Corners_of_the_Earth). After a brief stint at Datel (creating tools for cheat codes for games) I started my PhD at Birmingham. 

While at Birmingham I created my company, [Secret Attic Software](https://www.secretattic.co.uk/), and I also developed an ecological simulation game for the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth. 

On completion of my PhD I joined the team at Astraware, developing games for the newly released iPhone and Android devices, including [Astraware Mahjong](https://www.webosnation.com/astraware-mahjong) which sold rather a lot of copies. I left Astraware to work full time building up my own company, which developed apps for organisations such as Keele University, the NHS, Coventry University and the British Army. 

Research Background
======
My publications are detailed in the publications tab ^^^^. My research has revolved around games / VR, but mostly Artificial Life which includes developing Agent Based Models. During my PhD I researched how simulations responded to varying levels and types of complexity. This involved simulating models of marine biology (starfish / algae / mussells) and comparing the results when high and low resulution data was included, or when large and small populations were simulated. 

More recently I have been creating simulations of market based economies and simulating distruptive events. This has the aim of showing that agent-based decision making can show more resilience to system (i.e. government) decision making. 

I also supervise PhDs students who are typically either researching VR, gamification or AI (neural networks).
