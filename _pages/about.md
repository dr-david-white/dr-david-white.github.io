Welcome! I am a senior lecturer [at Staffordshire University](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/people/david-white) where I teach computer games programming and also involve myself in research in the fields of articial life (agent based models / simulations) and computer games. 

I have a PhD in Artificial Life and Simulation from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/eese/communications-sensing/hit-team/index.aspx) where I was a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof Bob Stone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-bob-stone-21b86918), who I'd previously worked with at [Virtual Presence / Virtalis](https://www.virtalis.com/). 

I also have a BSc (hons) in Computer Science (1st class) from Staffordshire University. 

Industry Background
======
I have been working in and around the games industry for 20+ years. I started out at Virtual Presence (now Virtalis) working on a VR simulator for the Ministry of Defence - specifically, a 20mm anti-aircraft gun simulator. VR was expensive in those days, £10,000 for a decent graphics card, and £80,000 for a VR headset! I then moved to Headfirst productions to work on the now cult game [Call of Cthulhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Cthulhu:_Dark_Corners_of_the_Earth). After a brief stint at Datel (creating tools for cheat codes for games) I started my PhD at Birminghamm. 

While at Birmingham I created my company, [Secret Attic Software](https://www.secretattic.co.uk/), and I also developed an ecological simulation game for the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth. 

On completion of my PhD I worked at Astraware, developing games for the newly released iPhone and Android devices (I developed [Astraware Mahjong](https://www.webosnation.com/astraware-mahjong) which sold rather a lot of copies). I then worked full time for my own company developing apps for organisations such as Keele University, the NHS, Coventry University and the British Army.
